# WiFind-pi

An attempt to make it easy to connect a headless Raspberry Pi to a WiFi network.
This is intended to be a black box used by a Python application to reliably
connect to a WiFi network using a fixed IP address where the end user either 
doesn't have access to the router to set a fixed address  
or doesn't know how to do it  
or doesn't want to bother.
